Nora is a microbiologist who joined the Stajich Lab in 2022 as a first-year Ph.D. student in the Microbiology program. I earned my B.S Bachelors of Science in Biology and M.S. in Biological Sciences from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. My research interests include microbiology, mycology, fungal genetics, and bioinformatics. 
My current research focuses on the amphibian pathogen _Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_.

When Iâ€™m not busy reading and conducting research in the lab, I enjoy spending time with my son and cooking, for family and friends.
