Congratulations to [Dr. Tania Kurbessoian](/team/members/tania-kurbessoian) who completed her PhD work at the end of 2022.
Tania was an integral part of the lab advancing new culturingi projects, a thoughtful and giving student mentor, and a key 
person in our data analysis of black yeast fungi. The lab greatly benefited from her efforts to keep the wet lab efficient
for molecular biology, microbiology, and genomics techniques.
