Congrats to [Divya ](http://lab.stajich.org/home/people/divya-sain/ "Divya Sain")and Jason as our paper with collaborators Hugo Melida and [Vincent Bulone](http://www.biotech.kth.se/glycoscience/Vincent_Bulone): <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deciphering the uniqueness of Mucoromycotina cell walls by combining biochemical and phylogenomic approaches</span> is now [available at Environmental Microbiology](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.12601 "Env Micro"). We discovered in this work that two Mucoromycotina species have novel fucose sugar composition in their cell walls which is not found in other Fungi. We also identify expansions and unique subfamilies of Chitin synthase genes.![Fig1_Mucormycotinacellwall](/images/wp_upload/2014/08/Fig1_Mucormycotinacellwall.png)
