The lab will open in July 2009 at UC Riverside and be housed in the new [genomics](http://genomics.ucr.edu) building on campus. [![redflower](http://stajichlab.fungalgenomes.org/home/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/3242806294_335e89c67d-150x150.jpg "redflower")](http://flickr.com/photos/stajich/3242806294/)We are excited to be taking advantage of the existing [computational](http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~tgirke/Tools.htm#Hardware) and [genomics resources](http://www.cif.ucr.edu/) available on campus as well as collaborating with our evolutionary, mycological, and bioinformatics colleagues.Specific information about positions for postdocs, graduate students, and technicians will be available in late spring, but interested persons should feel free to contact [Jason](/home/people/jason-stajich/).
