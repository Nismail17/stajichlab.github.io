To the newly finished Genomics building on campus.  Our (well only me still ) move date in mid-September or when the office furniture is installed.[![You've got keys](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2427/3857622906_472956bea6.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stajich/3857622906/ "You've got keys by jason.stajich, on Flickr")Yah!  Freezers, fridges, ordered.  A few lab compute servers are being placed.  Slowly getting things up and running.
