Back from an excellent meeting in St Feliu du Guixols for the EMBO Comparative Genomics of Eukaryotic Microorganisms. Not a strictly fungi focused meeting, but lots of genome comparisons of yeasts and molds were presented. Â It will be held again in 2 years so mark your calendars as it is a great scientific exchange and a beautiful location.
