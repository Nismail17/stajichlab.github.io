## Fungal Evolutionary Genomics Lab

{% capture text %}
[Research](research) in the lab focuses on evolution of fungi through use of genetic and genomic approaches incorporating experimental and computational tools. We are focused on evolutionary relationships of fungi in particular [zygomycete](http://zygolife.org/home/) and chytrid fungi. <br>

[Lab Website Template](https://github.com/greenelab/lab-website-template) is an easy-to-use, flexible website template for [labs](https://www.greenelab.com/), with automatic citations, GitHub tag imports, pre-built components, and more.
Spend less time reinventing the wheel, and more time running your lab.
